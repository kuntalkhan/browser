# 🌐 Mini Browser Application

A sleek and minimalistic browser interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This lightweight project allows users to search directly or enter URLs to load websites within an embedded iframe or redirect to Google search.

- 💡 **Embedded Viewing** – Displays valid websites inside a responsive `iframe`.
- 🎯 **Instant Access** – Press `Enter` or click the search button to load content seamlessly.
- 📱 **Responsive Design** – Optimized for desktops and tablets.
- 🎨 **Modern UI** – Clean, glassy interface with smooth shadows and gradients.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure
- **CSS3** – Modern styling with Flexbox and shadow effects
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – DOM manipulation and smart URL detection

## 🖥️ How It Works

1. The input field checks whether the user input matches a URL pattern (`www.example.com`).
2. If valid, it prepends `https://` (if missing) and loads the page in an `iframe`.
3. If invalid, it performs a Google search in a new tab.
